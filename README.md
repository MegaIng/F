# F
An Implementation of F by @ac1235 (https://ac1235.github.io/f.html)

## Implementation Details

* Syntax completely like in the documentation by @ac1235 (All of his example can be parsed)
* Numbers are always the `Decimal` type from python.
* Strings have simple escaping (will be changed) and are written between `"`
* Some fundamental functions are still missing

## How to use

* install the latest version of [python 3 (at least 3.7)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* execute `pip install lark-parser`
* execute `python f.py test.f`
